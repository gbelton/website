# Biography

As a Business Intelligence Developer for North Carolina's State Employee Health Plan, I spend my days writing SAS code and preparing data for the business users. I've recently discovered that I also have a passion for teaching.  I know that learning statistics can, and should, be fun. It is, after all, the mathematics of games and gambling. I am always working to communicate this sense of fun to my students.

I was born in Baton Rouge, LA and lived for many years in New Orleans. I moved to Durham in 1999 and currently live in Creedmoor, NC, about 25 miles North of Raleigh. When Iâ€™m not in the office or doing schoolwork, you can usually find me playing guitar in a bluegrass jam somewhere, or driving my roadster on twisty mountain roads.
