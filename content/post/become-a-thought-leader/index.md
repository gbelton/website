Annie Pettit, PhD, FMRIA. 64 pages, $5.50 on <a href="http://amzn.to/2mAoRu5">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the small size or the low price of this little book. I consider it one of the most valuable in my collection, and the time I've spent reading it (and re-reading it, over and over) has paid dividends far beyond what I would have expected.</p>

<p>What does Dr. Pettit mean by a "Thought Leader?" She explains it in her introduction:</p>
<p>"Being a thought leader means that people have learned to seek out your advice and opinions because you have proven your insights are unique and meaningful, your expertise is trustworthy, you seek to remain at the forefront of knowledge in your field, you are open to being respectfully challenged on your opinions, and you are genuinely happy to share your knowledge with people."</p>
<p>The Seven Strategies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognize your expertise</li>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Be genuine</li>
<li>Be clickbait</li>
<li>Use Your voice for good</li>
<li>Don't be a sales pitch</li>
<li>Start now</li>
</ol>
<p>And the Ten Tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leverage your credentials</li>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Speak virtually</li>
<li>Speak in person</li>
<li>Meet</li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Mentor</li>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Find ideas</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't go into more detail on any of these, because you really should read the book. But I will talk about the first Strategy, "Recognize your expertise." You may be thinking, "I'm no expert." Pettit has an answer for that, in large, bold, letters on the page after the title page:<br>
</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>You <em>are</em> an expert.</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone is an expert on something, according to Pettit, and she devotes three pages to helping you discover where your expertise lies.</p>
<p>Becoming a thought leader is good for your personal growth and it's good for business. Read the book. Follow the advice. Become a thought leader.</p>
<p>But be warned: As a thought leader, you'll have to think twice before you say the stupid stuff you now say so freely. If you're like me, expect to spend some time deleting stuff from your social media after you read this book!</p>
